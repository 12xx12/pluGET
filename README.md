# pluGET

A powerfull package manager which handles [Plugins](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/) for minecraft servers.

## About  
This is a package manager for minecraft [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) servers and its forks (e.g. [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/)).  
This is a standalone program written in python.  
The program works with a locally installed server or with a remote host through SFTP, when configured in the config.  
It uses the [Spiget](https://spiget.org/) API to download and compare plugin versions and can download the latest version of plugins from the [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) site.  

Plugin management was the hard part of mangaging a minecraft server. The time it took to check the [Spigot ressource](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/) page for updates for the installed plugins and updating all plugins manually which have available updates was too long and shocking.  
So I built pluGET to automate and ease the plugin handling of a minecraft server and to turn the most time consuming part of managing a minecraft server to an easy one.  

This program is suited for minecraft server owners who want to save time and stay on top of their plugin versions.  
The program input and the associated config file are pretty simple so every server owner and not only the most tech savy ones can use pluGET to ease their plugin handling.  

Follow the [Installation](https://github.com/Neocky/pluGET#installation) guide below for an easy and hassle free setup of pluGET.  
Read [Usage](https://github.com/Neocky/pluGET#usage) below to get some example inputs when using pluGET.  
If you still have questions [here](https://github.com/Neocky/pluGET#need-help) is the best place to ask for support.  

So what can it do exactly?  
pluGET can:
- work locally or through sftp
- download the latest version of a plugin
- update every installed/one specific plugin
- check for an update of every installed/one specific plugin
- remove a plugin from the plugin folder  

There are more features in the work. Check [Projects](https://github.com/Neocky/pluGET/projects) for a complete list.  

**So why do it manually when you can use pluGET to automate it?** ðŸš€
